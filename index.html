          <p class="font-medium pl-4">a. Usage Data</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-8 space-y-1">

            ReflectQ provides a virtual currency feature (CoinQ) that can be used to access AI-based features within the Application. The use of CoinQ will be debited from the User's balance when the system runs AI-based features through a paid provider (OpenAI), including but not limited to situations where the system performs an automatic fallback due to service failure at the free content provider (EQuran) to ensure service continuity for the User. Users can obtain CoinQ through purchases using In-App Purchase (IAP) processed by Apple Pay. In the coin purchase process:

            <li>The information we receive is limited to the transaction status, the amount of CoinQ purchased, and the transaction time for record-keeping and service provision purposes.</li>

            3. DEVICE ACCESS PERMISSION
          </h4>
          <p>To support certain functions, ReflectQ may request device access permissions as follows:</p>
          <p class="font-medium pl-4">a. Calendar</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Used to support automatic reflection reminders. ReflectQ does not read,
            modify, or store calendar contents other than creating reminder entries.
          </p>

          <p class="font-medium mt-4 pl-4">b. Camera</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            ReflectQ may request camera access permission on the User's device to support certain features within the Application. Camera access is used in a limited and contextual manner, namely to allow Users to take pictures directly through the device's camera as part of the poster creation feature.<br><br>
            Camera access is only used when the User actively chooses to use the feature and is not done automatically or run in the background. Images taken through the camera will be stored in the ReflectQ system. ReflectQ does not access the camera without the User's consent and does not use the image data taken for purposes other than providing the App's features. Users can change or revoke camera access permissions at any time through their device settings.
          </p>

          <p class="font-medium mt-4 pl-4">c. Media Access</p>
          <p>This access allows Users to select images from their device gallery for:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-8 space-y-1">
            <li>Profile photo</li>
            <li>Inspirational poster creation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The application only accesses images explicitly selected by the User and does not scan or access the entire gallery. Selected images will be securely uploaded to the ReflectQ server.</p>

          <p class="font-medium mt-4 pl-4">d. Notification</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            The ReflectQ app has a push notification feature to deliver relevant and important information related to service usage, including notifications about reflection schedules related to user experiences. The delivery of these push notifications aims to ensure that users receive information in a timely and efficient manner.<br><br>In its implementation, we utilize the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service, which is integrated with the Apple Push Notification Service (APNs), to enable the secure delivery of notifications to users' iOS devices. This process uses a technical device identifier, namely a push notification token, which serves solely for the purpose of delivering notifications and managing services. This identifier is technical in nature, may change over time, and is not used and cannot be used to personally identify users.<br><br>We do not collect, store, or process users' personal data in connection with the delivery of these push notifications. Users have full control over this feature and can grant or revoke permission to receive push notifications at any time through the settings on their respective iOS devices.
